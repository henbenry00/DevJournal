Initially set up VSCode and linked with GitHub for the first time.
Downloaded GIT so I can use bash commands instead of PowerShell for terminal and ease of use with GitHub.

Made a new repository to track my progress, and I am getting a good framework set up to make sure I can have everything documented in an efficient manner.

1. Set up an Expo app so I can learn the whole mobile app and react framework.

Used bash commands to set up node.js and npm/npx. Currently accessing app via iPhone for dev.

Check out the repo: https://github.com/henbenry00/pomo

2. Started making some changes and learning how to navigate the expo app / react.

3. Working on some JS

4. I decided to setup a Vite app so I can start somewhere with my JS skills. Will be adding on to that periodically.

5. Working on writing a few automation scripts with powershell for random applications.
