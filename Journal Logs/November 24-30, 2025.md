**November 25** 

Initially set up VSCode and linked with GitHub for the first time.
Downloaded GIT so I can use bash commands instead of PowerShell for terminal and ease of use with GitHub.

Made a new repository to track my progress, and I am getting a good framework set up to make sure I can have everything documented in an efficient manner.
